# Functional GPT-2
An implementation of GPT-2 in a functional style.

Unfortunately, this is written in Python :(. I wanted to write it
in Lisp, but I couldn't find a decent Lisp library for machine learning
(and it's a lot of work to make my own). Elixir seems to be the only
functional programming language with decent machine learning libraries
that I could find at this time (6 October 2024). Perhaps I will eventually
rewrite this in Elixir, but probably not.
